# Legends of Math Prodigy

Legends of Math Prodigy: A twist on Legends of Kingdom Rush and Math Prodigy! 

Set in a fantasy kingdom, the fundamental objective of the turn-based, role-play game requires a user to complete an adventure-based quest in order to defeat the enemies in the realm. During the quest, the user must traverse through a map until they reach the final node on the map: the node where the boss enemy is located, thus, resulting in an ultimate face-off to determine if the user will either win or lose the game. Throughout the adventure, the user must complete various challenges, math-based problems, and battles to defeat any enemies they may encounter along the way; however, if unsuccessful in defeating the enemy, the game is ended.
